# These Are Not the Droids You Are Looking For

If you've arrived here, you're probably looking for the standard [`quill-delta-to-html`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-delta-to-html) package, not this one.

(This is a special-purpose fork of that package that changes some behavior.  Although it's open source, it's not intended for general use.)

## If you're sure you want this package...

  - Installation:

    ```
    npm install @sudowrite/quill-delta-to-html-fork
    ```

  - Usage:

    Same as regular `quill-delta-to-html`.
